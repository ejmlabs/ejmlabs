# Chess continuation handoff

Status recorded on 2026-10-24. This change has **58 of 71 tasks checked**.
The current [task file](tasks.md) is authoritative. This handoff preserves
source and execution facts; it changes no launch scope, limits or approval.

## Read before resuming

- [Proposal](proposal.md), [design](design.md), [launch scope](launch-scope.md)
  and the six [delta specs](specs/) describe the approved work.
- [Implementation scope](implementation-scope.md) contains dated evidence and
  earlier boundaries. Read it with later approved decisions; do not treat an
  old local-only limit or financial allocation as current policy.
- [Baseline verification](../reconcile-chess-planning-baseline/verification.md)
  records addition-only prerequisite and spec-merge checks. It proves neither
  runtime correctness nor release readiness.
- The [repository handoff](../../HANDOFF.md) covers owner and publication
  dependencies.

## Current source state

The former temporary product checkout and temporary PR checkout are absent.
There is no active `ejm-chess` working checkout to resume. The retained product
had no committed HEAD. Its source must be restored into an owner-scoped
repository before build, review or deployment.

This Studio PR contains planning and Studio work. It does not contain the
complete chess runtime or private deployment configuration. Shared visual
behavior and assets belong in `ejm-ui`; chess rules, DTOs, state and deployment
belong in `ejm-chess`. Consume public `@ejm/*` exports when restoring the product.

## Latest retained execution results

The final records below are from 2026-10-23. No live provider readback was made
while preparing this handoff, so they are last-known state.

| Area | Retained result | What remains unproved |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Friend game | Two players completed e4, d6, resignation, reload, history, replay and PGN before the final deployment. | Later source and deployed revisions need checks only where their contracts changed. |
| Earlier proof Q21 | Transient-start and interrupted results produced one technical void at the original deadline, no rating event and a released slot. Physical stop was confirmed. | The intended killed-solver case did not pass. |
| Proof Q22 | Qualification failed. G13 was incomplete, with two deliveries and no credit. Competition capture returned `proof_acceptance_work_exhausted`; its cause was not established. | Real killed-solver receipt, required recovery and final proof qualification. |
| Q22 cleanup | Logical stop passed. Physical readback showed cap zero and no active or assigned instances. Wrapper and cutoff processes exited. | This stop receipt does not establish qualification. |
| Capacity full22 | Failed at final registration confirmations with five HTTP 503 responses. It recorded 10,829 acknowledged registration replies, 1,225 distinct confirmed accounts, zero charged Game IDs and zero native Game objects. | No passing full workload, first-tier capacity or large-event release claim. |
| Capacity cleanup | Saved owner stop was confirmed, temporary test exception was removed and the local driver exited. Resources and traces were retained. | Native shutdown was not confirmed. Do not claim full native retirement. |

The earlier release evidence map was written before these final outcomes.
Use the stopped-run summaries when continuing. Root acceptance of a packet,
source sealing, local readiness and a buffered trace header are not passing
execution results.

**Every historical qualification window has expired.** Do not restart an old
job, reuse a prior run identity as a new attempt, reopen a stopped control,
refund uncertainty, reuse an old PID or execute an expired schedule. Preserve
all prior failures, permits, reservations, traces and charges.

### Partial capacity diagnostic patch

The retained product source includes an unfinished failure-receipt patch in:

- `src/shared/capacity-failure.ts`
- `src/server/capacity-meter.ts`
- `src/server/capacity-native.ts`
- `src/server/capacity-protocol.ts`
- `src/server/capacity-qualification.ts`
- `scripts/capacity-driver.mjs`
- `test/capacity-failure.test.ts`
- `test/capacity-native.test.ts`

It adds a fixed code allowlist, bounded sanitized RPC failure receipts and
driver retention of matching audit headers. Real HTTP 503 responses remain
failures or uncertainty. Lost transport can still leave the cause unknown.
No audit storage or provider logging was added.

The patch is **partial, unreviewed, untested and undeployed**. Focused tests and
typecheck from earlier source do not verify it. Remaining work includes native
throw-before-finish retention, driver receipt persistence and rejection checks,
affected typecheck, guide updates and source review before sealing a candidate.

## Unchecked tasks

These labels are unchanged from [tasks.md](tasks.md):

| Labels | Remaining contract |
| --- | --- |
| 3.6 | Complete required two-browser board interaction and accessibility coverage. The completed friend flow above is partial evidence. |
| 3.8 | Qualify the timeout-proof contract, ordinary flags, failures, finite attempts, recovery and stops. |
| 4.5 | Finish policy guidance and verify game, history and leaderboard flows together. |
| 6.2 | Complete provider, mail and deployed cost evidence. Reuse verified delivery and reset evidence while those contracts remain unchanged. |
| 6.3 | Finish spending, storage, recovery, privacy and accepted-work controls and their readback. |
| 6.4 | Complete the required measurements. Broader regional work remains unfinished beyond the initial opening gate. |
| 7.1 | Finish critical-path protected-host player and integration checks against recorded deployed source. |
| 7.2 | Open public ranked and first-tier arenas only after their approved critical-path gates pass; verify live limits and guides. |
| 7.3 | Publish verified shared discovery and Studio adoption after product and guide destinations pass. |
| 10.4 | Finish and qualify the large-event design, standings, recovery and published limits. |
| 18.3 | Resolve registration diagnostics while retaining prior failures and accounting. No passing registration-only diagnostic is recorded. |
| 18.4 | Run the full approved native workload against a freshly reviewed repaired candidate. |
| 18.5 | Reconcile all retained failures, usage, receipts, stops and documented measured limits. |

The critical-path capacity target remains three 2,000-entry events, a combined
1,000 unfinished-game cap, 19,000 required and 20,000 maximum native admissions,
the full 900-second stream and the approved ten-second recovery lead. These are
test requirements, not supported capacity. The shorter run does not complete
the longer calendar, full-hour endurance, regional or later-tier qualification.

The current plan retains the single $100 monthly target and existing spending
stops, including the combined $25 capacity-test ceiling. A target, quota or
alert cannot guarantee a provider invoice cap. This handoff adds no allowance
and changes no limit.

## Retained source

The private recovery note accompanying PR preparation names archive storage and
private manifests. They remain outside this public repository. The retention
audit verified every archive hash, member hash, mode and inventory
against those manifests with no mismatches.

| Archive | Files | SHA-256 |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `ejm-chess-source.tar.gz` | 322 | `808a000963a2d7eb50015ab2a6950ee5dd5cf111bb66b8fdbe2fe46d37295036` |
| `ejm-chess-source-provenance.tar.gz` | 64 | `58d91a5fe6ee82ef745e8d7251584f2b58e72f23bd3817e11d4f3f9e0bbb604b` |
| `ejm-ui-source.tar.gz` | 1,085 | `544d5bd1fad6261600190c4b19a777a73b34906cbf9a4abc556a34fc178fa90c` |

Retention is not a complete repository freeze or a build result. It excludes
credentials, private configuration, dependencies, generated app and Worker
bundles, caches and runtime state. All six Wrangler configurations are omitted.
The package manifest retains machine-specific absolute `file:` references to
public UI packages. Reconstruct reviewed configuration and rebind those public
package paths and the lockfile in the owning repository before checking source.
Do not copy private provider configuration or secrets into the public tree.

The archives retain engine and proof inputs and notices. Their preservation
does not claim a new integrity audit, license review, build or execution
qualification. The provenance archive and private records must be reviewed
before any wider publication.

## Resume in this order

1. Restore the product and required shared owner source from the verified
   archives into durable owner checkouts. Read each owner's current rules.
   Record new source identities, dependency bindings and configuration gaps.
2. Refresh OpenSpec status and apply instructions. Review the partial capacity
   patch and finish only the affected failure, native and driver checks plus
   typecheck. Retain old results as historical evidence.
3. Diagnose the retained proof and registration failures. Reconcile prior work
   and current provider state before preparing any fresh execution packet.
   Preserve all held uncertainty and stop receipts.
4. Prepare a new feasible schedule and immutable candidate within the existing
   approved scope. Follow the review and finite-work requirements in the plan.
   Never resume an expired packet or infer success from readiness.
5. Finish ranked proof and recovery, then the full capacity workload and its
   accounting and stop readback. Derive enabled limits from actual results.
6. Finish only the remaining protected-host player checks. Reuse the friend,
   mail and privacy evidence where unchanged contracts support doing so.
7. Update product guides with measured limits and unrun checks. Build and deploy
   accepted source, verify canonical public access, then publish discovery in
   `ejm-ui` and Studio through their owner processes.
8. Update task checkboxes only from verified results. Sync and archive completed
   scope after required checks pass; retain longer follow-up work explicitly.

No launch, provider mutation, new workload or live documentation publication
was performed while writing this handoff.
